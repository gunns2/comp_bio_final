plan for clustering:

give the following each a weight of 1/3:

GC content

tetranucleotide frequency
	with each having uniform weight 

coverage


steps:
reads generated 
—->
aligned to ref genome via Bowtie2
—->
coverage calculated via Bedtools
for each contain: use bedrolls output to come up with weighted average, to use as coverage for each contig
—->
log transform of coverage (maybe)

—->
cluster according to this log transform of coverage
—->
then maybe use this information as preferences for affinity propagation using sci-kit, idk binsanity paper does not discuss this, but i’m not sure how to pass clustering information from coverage clusters to GC and tetranuc otherwise

questions:
what is our similarity function? it seems like we have to choose one, Binsanity uses euclidean distance, maybe mahalanobis is better.
